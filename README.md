Coding is my life-saver, or better known as a life guide. In lockdown, while I was wasting my time in Minecraft, coding change me - it let me find myself another way for my life instead of studying. 

Starting from basic programming (using Python), and then front-end development (nodeJS), and now competitive programming (C++), I learnt a lot more than just coding - new friendcircle, new community, and also knew about what friend should I avoid.

In 2022, competitive programming brought me to another diversity...although I did less effort. It totally change me, bringing me more confidences and be brave. Also, it brings me motivations in my life, plus making me more self-disciplined.
